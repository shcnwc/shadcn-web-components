  jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
  leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup, even
  in the royal toilet- the king was furious, but he couldn't seem to stop
  jokester- and then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the
  jokes left by jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh- and
  once they started laughing, they couldn't stop-
